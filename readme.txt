I am a Scottish educator experienced in working with children and young people in a wide range of settings - nurseries, primary schools, out of school clubs, high schools, youth clubs, summer schools, pipe bands and football teams to name a few! I also have experience tutoring foreign learners online in my native tongue, English, and am persuing private students in a range of subjects at a number of levels. This includes online tuition in how to play the bagpipes.
